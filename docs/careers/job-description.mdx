## **Main Responsibilities**

**1. Partner Business Support**

We provide support to companies that resonate with DoobooLab's spirit and are a good fit for our services. Our approach is not a typical outsourcing model, but rather a unique one built on years of experience. This allows our developers to work comfortably and receive respect from our partners. Our developers have high satisfaction rates as they successfully meet the needs of our partners.

**2. Education and Consulting**

Our representative primarily teaches students on a quarterly basis, but many have grown and now hope to operate educational businesses together. As the workload increases, so does the incentive.

**3. Community Leadership and Research & Development**

With a vision of not just focusing on the company's success, we are also dedicated to the community. We also discover and maintain numerous popular open-source libraries from abroad. All of these are conducted autonomously during work hours.

By making a conscious effort to align your learning with the group's needs, you'll be an invaluable contributor to our collective success.

Let's learn, share, and shine together!

## **Qualifications**

We are looking for candidates who can demonstrate exceptional passion for development. You should be familiar with RDBMS, OOP, functional programming, CRUD, git, and more. However, we prioritize attitude over technical skills, as we have found that a positive attitude ultimately leads to technical advantages. We believe that a person who grows quickly is greater than one who is already well-equipped.

We primarily hire those who have development experience, as development is considered a fundamental skill within our company. The roles are distinguished based on the proportion of development tasks.

**Core Engineer**is a developer who wants to invest more time in a particular area while handling various tasks.

- Minimum 3 years of experience.

**Research Engineer** continuously researches the latest technologies and applies them to actual products. They then ensure other developers can smoothly take over the development. They also often handle data-related tasks.

**\* We distinguish roles as described above, rather than dividing them into front-end, back-end, data, etc.**

[Attitude]

- You must have a constant desire to grow. You should not ignore existing issues, but continuously improve and solve them, and focus on helping your team achieve success. You must understand why it's essential to support your team's growth.
- You should have a restless personality, eager to grow both in and out of work. If you only do the tasks given during work hours and don't spend other time learning, it may be challenging to lead the community with technical superiority. This does not mean you should study 24/7, but rather have a sense of mission.
- You should be a team player, not someone who works alone. We believe that an individualistic development culture is harmful to growth.
- You should prioritize the organization's attachment and affection over individualistic thinking. You must promote collective growth and success, and of course, we will also do our best!

[Caution]

- If the actual working style does not suit you, you may feel isolated and unhappy within the organization. This is an undesirable direction for both parties, so please consider carefully before joining us. If you feel that our attitude aligns perfectly with yours, please click "Apply" right away!
