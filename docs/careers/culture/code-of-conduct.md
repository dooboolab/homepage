### Skimping is a waste of time

At our organization, we believe that doing a task hastily or without care is just as detrimental as not doing it at all. We encourage our members to always strive for excellence and produce the best possible outcomes in all tasks.

If there are any obstacles hindering your ability to perform at your best, please speak up immediately. We are committed to removing any distractions and creating a conducive environment where you can fully focus on your work.

### Non-delivered are not tasks

In order to work effectively as a community, it's essential that all work is communicated before it's executed. Working in isolation can lead to a loss of direction, which can ultimately be detrimental to the interests of the company as a whole.

To achieve a shared goal, rather than an individual one, it's crucial that everyone is aligned and working towards the same objective. By ensuring that all work is communicated and executed with a clear sense of direction and purpose, we can maximize our collective impact and drive the company forward.

### Know how to repay trust

We firmly believe that trust is built on steadiness and consistency. We understand that a work environment based on trust not only maximizes efficiency and productivity, but also creates a positive and supportive culture.

Some may assume that once trust is earned, it can be maintained without effort. However, we disagree. We strongly believe that it's crucial for all members to take responsibility and actively work towards maintaining trust. Betraying the trust of others can have a negative impact not only on our relationships, but also on our work as a whole.

Our organization strives to cultivate a culture of responsibility and accountability, where trust is earned and maintained through consistent actions. This ensures that we can work together effectively towards our common goals, while upholding the values of integrity and mutual respect.

### Unlimited freedom unlimited responsibility

We believe in avoiding strict rules and giving our members the autonomy to manage their own working hours, vacations, and other aspects of their work-life balance. We prioritize a minimum level of discipline that's necessary for the smooth operation of our company.

However, we also recognize that responsibility must precede freedom. We believe that when our members have a sense of responsibility and ownership, freedom can bring significant benefits to our community. By entrusting our members with the flexibility and freedom they need to excel, we can create a work environment that fosters creativity, innovation, and personal growth.

We strive to cultivate a culture of responsibility and accountability, where our members are empowered to take ownership of their work and contribute to the collective success of our organization. By embracing responsibility, we can unlock the full potential of our members and achieve our goals together as a community.

### Start working after understanding

We recognize that many mistakes are caused by errors in communication. If a message is not understood correctly, it's important to ask questions and clarify until there's a clear understanding.

We believe that more time is wasted on tasks performed without understanding than the time it takes to ask questions. Therefore, we encourage our members to never hesitate to ask questions when they are unsure or confused about a task or message.

We value open communication and the willingness to seek clarification as a way to minimize mistakes and increase productivity. Don't be afraid to ask questions - it's a sign of diligence and a commitment to achieving success as a team.

### Sense of responsibility for the role

Every individual has a role and a responsibility to contribute to the success of our organization. Roles define the expected behavior of individuals in society, and we strive to maintain a culture where every member is aware of their role and works with a sense of duty.

We have encountered individuals with a passive attitude towards their role, who prefer to only work on tasks that they enjoy and avoid tasks they consider someone else's responsibility. We believe that this attitude stems from a lack of awareness and understanding of their role in the organization.

We prioritize the awareness and recognition of each member's role in contributing to our collective success. We encourage our members to embrace their responsibilities with a sense of duty and actively work towards achieving our goals as a team. By doing so, we can create a culture of accountability and commitment, where every member takes pride in their role and strives to contribute to the greater good.
